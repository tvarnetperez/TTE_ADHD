# What's different in the Author Original Version?
The present folder contains the code for the Author Original Version of the article, i.e. 

>the un-refereed author version of an article completed before submission of the article to the journal. This is sometimes referred to as the “preprint” version. ([General Instructions from IJE](https://academic.oup.com/ije/pages/general_instructions))

The main differences are:

- Expanded introduction, analysis plan, flow diagram, results and sensitivity analyses (~1000 additional words).
- Main analysis is for the eligible sample including those that have been previously medicated (n = 11,835). This is the sample on which tables and figures are based on. The non-previously medicated sample (aka washout sample, n = 8,458) is also reported but as a sensitivity analysis rather than as main analysis in the journal version.
- All sensitivity analyses are reported, including unadjusted naive mean differences, negative control exposure estimates, proximal two stage least squares, washout sample (main analysis in journal version), and complete-case analyses.
- Effect summaries for all analyses in SATE scale (journal version presents estimated counterfactual means).
