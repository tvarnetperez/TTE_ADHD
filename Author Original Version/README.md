The present folder contains the code for the Author Original Version of the article. The main differences are:

- Expanded introduction, analysis plan, flow diagram, results and sensitivity analyses (~1000 additional words).
- Main analysis is for the eligible sample including those that have been previously medicated. The non-previously medicated sample (aka washout sample) is reported as well as a sensitivity analysis rather than as main analysis in the journal version.
- All sensitivity analyses are reported, including unadjusted naive mean differences, negative control exposure estimates, proximal two stage least squares, washout sample (main analysis in journal version), and complete-case analyses.
- Effect summaries for all analyses in SATE scale (journal version presents estimated counterfactual means).
