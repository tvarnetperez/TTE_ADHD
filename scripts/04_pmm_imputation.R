# Notes on aregImpute class object, "aI":
  # aI$na is a list of J variables, with each element being a vector of integer
    # indices of which values are missing

# Regarding convergence diagnostics
# # Paul BrÃ¼cke:
# In the summary output, we notice that some
# Rhat values are higher than 1.1
# indicating possible convergence problems.
# For models based on multiple imputed data sets,
# this is often a false positive: 
#   Chains of different submodels may not overlay
# each other exactly, since there were fitted to different data.
# Accordingly, we have to investigate the convergence of
# the submodels separately, which we can do by looking at
# round(fit_imp1$rhats, 2)

# Notes on the aregImpute algorithm:

# > `aregImpute` takes all aspects of uncertainty in the imputations into
#  account by using the bootstrap to approximate the process of drawing
#   predicted values from a full Bayesian predictive distribution.
# 
# The typical approach is to fit one single imputation model and then to
#  draw imputed values from its predictive distribution.
# 
# The imputation model is fitted to a sample of the observed data which could
#  have gone differently though. Thus `aregImpute` bootstraps the original
#   sample for each imputed dataset.
# 
# > the target variable is predicted using a sample with replacement
#  from the observations with non-missing target variable
# 
# 
# There are different steps. 
# 
# `areg` functions are only about fitting the imputation models. 
# Will use cross validation to choose number of knots if `nk` is a vector.
# 
# 
# aregImpute algorithm:
#   
#   I. Initialize (impute) missing values of variables with a random sample.
#  II. Repeat the following steps `burnin + number_imputations` times:
#     II.1. For each target variable with missing value X, draw a sample with 
#     replacement of size (length(X_obs)) of all the variables in the dataset.
#           II.1.a. Fit a flexible additive model to this sample, to predict 
#           the target (or different transformations of it)
#           II.1.b. Use this flexible additive model to predict both observed 
#           and missing values of the target variable X
#           II.1.c. For each predicted missing value of X, use its distance to
#            predicted observed values of X to draw an observed value to impute
#             with (Predictive Mean Matching, match = "weighted").
#           II.1.d. Keep the only the last `number_imputations` iterations
# III. Use the imputed values from variable X when X is used as a predictor for
#  another target variable with missing values X'.
