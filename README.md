# TTE_ADHD
R Code for the analysis in the article: "Long-term effect of pharmacological treatment on academic achievement of Norwegian children diagnosed with ADHD: A Target Trial Emulation"

## Preliminaries

Due to the sensitive nature of the data, **the data used in the study is not directly available**. Data access can be requested to the corresponding organizations.
The present code is shared for transparency regarding the variety of choices done at the level of data processing and cleaning, model specification and sensitivity analysis, beyond what the main article's extension allows. For example, for the informal replication of the [Keilow et al. (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496240/) study, the script `09_keilow_replication.R` shows the analytic strategy replicated, together with the output of all analyses in the form of comments.

## Structure
The `main_script.R` file gives an overview of the tasks and output generated by each subscript. Numbering in the subscripts indicates the order in which they were run. The scripts were not run in a single execution of the main script, since many tasks such as `06_BART_definite.R` required to be run in job scripts in a [high-performance cluster](https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/colossus/) via Slurm.
